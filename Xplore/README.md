## ABOUT
Taking a good look at how the recent pandemic has disrupted the flow of regular activities in every individual, this is just as much similar to what wildlife species go through when human imposed actions causes a disrupt in their ecosystem. I have learnt to value life and the little things around me during this pandemic, to protect endangered species from extinction cause “you don’t know what you have till it’s gone”.
